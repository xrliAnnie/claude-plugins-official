# Discord — Access & Delivery

Discord only allows DMs between accounts that share a server. Who can DM your bot depends on where it's installed: one private server means only that server's members can reach it; a public community means every member there can open a DM.

The **Public Bot** toggle in the Developer Portal (Bot tab, on by default) controls who can add the bot to new servers. Turn it off and only your own account can install it. This is your first gate, and it's enforced by Discord rather than by this process.

For DMs that do get through, the default policy is **pairing**. An unknown sender gets a 6-character code in reply and their message is dropped. You run `/discord:access pair <code>` from your assistant session to approve them. Once approved, their messages pass through.

All state lives in `~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json`. The `/discord:access` skill commands edit this file; the server re-reads it on every inbound message, so changes take effect without a restart. Set `DISCORD_ACCESS_MODE=static` to pin config to what was on disk at boot (pairing is unavailable in static mode since it requires runtime writes).

## At a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Default policy | `pairing` |
| Sender ID | User snowflake (numeric, e.g. `184695080709324800`) |
| Group key | Channel snowflake — not guild ID |
| Config file | `~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json` |

## DM policies

`dmPolicy` controls how DMs from senders not on the allowlist are handled.

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `pairing` (default) | Reply with a pairing code, drop the message. Approve with `/discord:access pair <code>`. |
| `allowlist` | Drop silently. No reply. Use this once everyone who needs access is already on the list, or if pairing replies would attract spam. |
| `disabled` | Drop everything, including allowlisted users and guild channels. |

```
/discord:access policy allowlist
```

## User IDs

Discord identifies users by **snowflakes**: permanent numeric IDs like `184695080709324800`. Usernames are mutable; snowflakes aren't. The allowlist stores snowflakes.

Pairing captures the ID automatically. To add someone manually, enable **User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode** in Discord, then right-click any user and choose **Copy User ID**. Your own ID is available by right-clicking your avatar in the lower-left.

```
/discord:access allow 184695080709324800
/discord:access remove 184695080709324800
```

## Guild channels

Guild channels are off by default. Opt each one in individually, keyed on the **channel** snowflake (not the guild). Threads inherit their parent channel's opt-in; no separate entry needed. Find channel IDs the same way as user IDs: Developer Mode, right-click the channel, Copy Channel ID.

```
/discord:access group add 846209781206941736
```

With the default `requireMention: true`, the bot responds only when @mentioned or replied to. Pass `--no-mention` to process every message in the channel, or `--allow id1,id2` to restrict which members can trigger it.

```
/discord:access group add 846209781206941736 --no-mention
/discord:access group add 846209781206941736 --allow 184695080709324800,221773638772129792
/discord:access group rm 846209781206941736
```

## Mention detection

In channels with `requireMention: true`, any of the following triggers the bot:

- A structured `@botname` mention (typed via Discord's autocomplete)
- A reply to one of the bot's recent messages
- A match against any regex in `mentionPatterns`

Example regex setup for a nickname trigger:

```
/discord:access set mentionPatterns '["^hey claude\\b", "\\bassistant\\b"]'
```

## Delivery

Configure outbound behavior with `/discord:access set <key> <value>`.

**`ackReaction`** reacts to inbound messages on receipt as a "seen" acknowledgment. Unicode emoji work directly; custom server emoji require the full `<:name:id>` form. The emoji ID is at the end of the URL when you right-click the emoji and copy its link. Empty string disables.

```
/discord:access set ackReaction 🔨
/discord:access set ackReaction ""
```

**`replyToMode`** controls threading on chunked replies. When a long response is split, `first` (default) threads only the first chunk under the inbound message; `all` threads every chunk; `off` sends all chunks standalone.

**`textChunkLimit`** sets the split threshold. Discord rejects messages over 2000 characters, which is the hard ceiling.

**`chunkMode`** chooses the split strategy: `length` cuts exactly at the limit; `newline` prefers paragraph boundaries.

### Gateway recovery and alerts

Gateway self-healing is opt-in and uses messages the plugin already sends; it
does not create polling or synthetic Discord traffic. Configure these values in
the same `DISCORD_STATE_DIR/.env` as the bot token, then restart the plugin:

| Variable | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_GATEWAY_WATCH=1` | Enables a one-shot forced reconnect when Discord's normal shard reconnect does not recover within 90 seconds. Missing, `0`, or any other value is off. |
| `DISCORD_ECHO_PROBE=1` | Enables a one-shot forced reconnect when a successful plugin REST send is not echoed back through the gateway within 60 seconds. Missing, `0`, or any other value is off. |
| `DISCORD_ALERT_CHANNEL=<channel snowflake>` | Destination for unrecoverable shard failures, failed recovery, and startup compatibility-guard failures. Use the lead's own allowlisted chat channel; this is not inferred from another setting. |

Alerting and lifecycle logging are **always active**, even when both recovery
flags are off. Alerts use the plugin's authenticated Discord REST client and
intentionally bypass the echo probe. A missing or invalid
`DISCORD_ALERT_CHANNEL` produces a loud startup warning; subsequent failures
are written to `gateway-health-dead-letter.jsonl` instead of being sent to a
guessed channel. Lifecycle evidence is retained in the bounded
`gateway-health.log` plus one rotated backup inside `DISCORD_STATE_DIR`.

Forced reconnect depends on the installed `discord.js` and transitive
`@discordjs/ws` private shard contract. The plugin validates both runtime
versions and the reconnect recovery enum at startup. If any part drifts, active
recovery stays disabled and the compatibility failure follows the same alert or
dead-letter path.

## Skill reference

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/discord:access` | Print current state: policy, allowlist, pending pairings, enabled channels. |
| `/discord:access pair a4f91c` | Approve pairing code `a4f91c`. Adds the sender to `allowFrom` and sends a confirmation on Discord. |
| `/discord:access deny a4f91c` | Discard a pending code. The sender is not notified. |
| `/discord:access allow 184695080709324800` | Add a user snowflake directly. |
| `/discord:access remove 184695080709324800` | Remove from the allowlist. |
| `/discord:access policy allowlist` | Set `dmPolicy`. Values: `pairing`, `allowlist`, `disabled`. |
| `/discord:access group add 846209781206941736` | Enable a guild channel. Flags: `--no-mention`, `--allow id1,id2`. |
| `/discord:access group rm 846209781206941736` | Disable a guild channel. |
| `/discord:access set ackReaction 🔨` | Set a config key: `ackReaction`, `replyToMode`, `textChunkLimit`, `chunkMode`, `mentionPatterns`. |

## Config file

`~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json`. Absent file is equivalent to `pairing` policy with empty lists, so the first DM triggers pairing.

```jsonc
{
  // Handling for DMs from senders not in allowFrom.
  "dmPolicy": "pairing",

  // User snowflakes allowed to DM.
  "allowFrom": ["184695080709324800"],

  // Bot user IDs allowed to bypass the bot message filter.
  // Only these bots can send messages that reach the assistant.
  // Absent or empty = all bot messages are dropped (default behavior).
  "allowBots": ["123456789012345678"],

  // Guild channels the bot is active in. Empty object = DM-only.
  "groups": {
    "846209781206941736": {
      // true: respond only to @mentions and replies.
      "requireMention": true,
      // Restrict triggers to these senders. Empty = any member (subject to requireMention).
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  },

  // Case-insensitive regexes that count as a mention.
  "mentionPatterns": ["^hey claude\\b"],

  // Reaction on receipt. Empty string disables.
  "ackReaction": "👀",

  // Threading on chunked replies: first | all | off
  "replyToMode": "first",

  // Split threshold. Discord rejects > 2000.
  "textChunkLimit": 2000,

  // length = cut at limit. newline = prefer paragraph boundaries.
  "chunkMode": "newline"
}
```
